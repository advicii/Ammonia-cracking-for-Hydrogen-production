# Ammonia-cracking-for-Hydrogen-production
Ammonia cracking for hydrogen production - a technical analysis supporting Europe’s decarbonisation. It evaluates NH₃ as a hydrogen carrier, covering thermodynamics, reactor design, catalysts, and purification. A tailored Germany steel case study demonstrates scalable, low-emission hydrogen solutions.
